Bugs: (next bug #5)
  Known:
    Bug #3:
    - Playwall: when placing a new wall check if there is already a wall there.
    Bug #2:
    - Playwall: when placing a new horizontal wall check if there is already a
    vertical wall there and vice versa.

  Solved:
    Bug #1:
    - Showboard: when printing the board's configuration, the walls do not have
    a middle section. For example, when printing a horizontal wall it prints
    like this: ===+===, instead it should be printed like this: =======.
    The same thing happens with vertical walls.
    Bug #4:
    - Playwall: when placing a new wall check if the wall is out of board's
    bounds.
