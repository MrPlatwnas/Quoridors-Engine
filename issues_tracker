    that is the player, we should consider "white" and "black" input the same
    as "w" and "b" input.

    that is the wall's orientation, we should consider the "horizontal" and
    "vertical" input the same as "h" and "v".

  Solved:
    Bug #1:
    - Showboard: when printing the board's configuration, the walls do not have
    a middle section. For example, when printing a horizontal wall it prints
    like this: ===+===, instead it should be printed like this: =======.
    The same thing happens with vertical walls.
    Bug #4:
    - Playwall: when placing a new wall check if the wall is out of board's
    bounds.
    Bug #3:
    - Playwall: when placing a new wall check if there is already a wall there.
