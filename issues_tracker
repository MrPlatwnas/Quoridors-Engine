Bugs: (next bug #15)
  Known:
    Bug #5:
    - Playwall: when reading the user's input, specifialy the first argument
    that is the player, we should consider "white" and "black" input the same
    as "w" and "b" input.
    Bug #7:
    - Playmove: when reading the user's input specificaly the first argument,
    that is the player, we should consider "white" and "black" inpute the same
    as "w" and "b" input.
    Bug #10:
    - Playmove: players can't move pass the 9th row, because playmove does not
    support user inputs with two numbers (ex. "playmove w e10" gets
    interpreted into "playmove w e1").
    Bug #14:
    - Showboard: when there are two or more vertical walls in a row, showboard
    does not print the character + between them.


  Solved:
    Bug #1:
    - Showboard: when printing the board's configuration, the walls do not have
    a middle section. For example, when printing a horizontal wall it prints
    like this: ===+===, instead it should be printed like this: =======.
    The same thing happens with vertical walls.
    Bug #4:
    - Playwall: when placing a new wall check if the wall is out of board's
    bounds.
    Bug #3:
    - Playwall: when placing a new wall check if there is already a wall there.
    Bug #12:
    - Playmove: players can play on top of each other.
    Bug #13:
    - Playmove: players can't play at the top row (x == 0).
    Bug #11:
    - Showboard: if the player is at the left side of the board (y == 0) then
    showboard won't show him/her. if the player is at the top left square
    then he will get printed all over the y == 0 column.
    Bug #9:
    - Winner: does not print a result.
    Bug #8:
    - Clean_board: add qtp compatibility.
    Bug #2:
    - Playwall: when placing a new horizontal wall check if there is already a
    vertical wall there and vice versa.
    Bug #6:
    - Playwall: when reading the user's input, specificaly the third argument
    that is the wall's orientation, we should consider the "horizontal" and
    "vertical" input the same as "h" and "v".
